After a long time of having no time I decided to release this code to the public though having no time to do that...
It has many flaws but it works and might be useful for somebody else in the current state.
In order to make it really useful a complete redesign is needed (threaded loading, midi input, more (and more flexible) in- and outputs, ...)
Version 0.1 can be considered alpha, not ready for production and will very likely not be updated by me.

Short intro how to install and usage:
In order to use the pd to lv2 bridge you need to have installed:
lv2 headers (on debian/ubuntu: lv2core must be installed)

Installation:
sudo apt-get instal lv2core

You also need libpd (also contained in this archive). libpd.so must be installed in your system's library path, e.g. /usr/lib/libpd.so

enter the directory for libpd and build it:

cd libpd 
make clean
make
cd libs
you should have a file libpd.so if everything went fine. To install libpd simply copy it:
sudo cp libpd.so /usr/lib/

also you need a folder .lv2 in your home directory where the plugins will be installed to:
mkdir ~/.lv2 

go into the main directory of this downloaded file and type:
make

this will build the lv2 plugin and put them individually inside folders. Either copy them manually where your lv2 plugins are located usually or use:

make install 
this will copy the plugins into ~/.lv2

If you want to convert your pd patch into a plugin have a look first at the 3 .pd files contained in this archive. Simply copy one of them and adjust it to your needs. The Name of the pd patch must begin with LV2. Then hit "make" and "make install again".

Until now it is best to put everything in one pd patch and use no abstractions - the next versions will support folders of pd files with abstractions in them.
